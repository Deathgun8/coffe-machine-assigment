This was a univertisty assigment where we had a company with 3 floors, we had to ask for the user how many people work in each floor.

Then we knew that each person takes 1 minute to go from one floor to another.

With all that, we had to calculate which floor we should allocate the coffe machine, knowing that each person drinks coffe once a day.

I'm glad that I could think in the logic of this code.
